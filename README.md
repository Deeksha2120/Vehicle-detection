# Vehicle-detection

To recognize License number plates using the Python programming language ,we will
utilize OpenCV for this project in order to identify the license number plates and the
python Pytesseract for the characters and digits extraction from the plate.
We will use the Python OpenCV library. It is an open-source library for machine learning
and offers a common infrastructure for computer vision. We will also use Pytesseract for
the project. Pytesseract is a Tesseract-OCR Engine to read images type and extract the
details available in the image.

# CNN Model
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN or ConvNet) is a subtype of Neural Networks
that is mainly used for applications in image and speech recognition. Its built-in
convolutional layer reduces the high dimensionality of images without losing its
information.
That is why CNNs are especially suited for this use case.
CNN can run directly on an underdone image and do not need any preprocessing.
A convolutional neural network is a feed forward neural network, seldom with up to 20.
The strength of a convolutional neural network comes from a particular kind of layer
called the convolutional layer.
CNN contains many convolutional layers assembled on top of each other, each one
competent at recognizing more sophisticated shapes.
With three or four convolutional layers it is viable to recognize handwritten digits and
with 25 layers it is possible to differentiate human faces.
The agenda for this sphere is to activate machines to view the world as humans do,
perceive it in a similar fashion and even use the knowledge for a multitude of duties such
as image and video recognition, image inspection and classification, media recreation,
recommendation systems, natural language processing, etc.
